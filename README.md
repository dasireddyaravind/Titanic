# Titanic

This project explores the Titanic passenger dataset to predict survival outcomes using machine learning techniques. The goal is to build a predictive model that can accurately determine whether a passenger survived or not.

Dataset

The dataset contains information about Titanic passengers, including features like age, gender, ticket class, cabin, and more. The target variable is 'Survived', indicating whether a passenger survived (1) or not (0).

Methodology

Data Exploration: Analyze data, identify missing values, and understand the distribution of variables.
Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, balance the target variable, and remove unnecessary features.
Model Building: Create a random forest model using the training data.
Predictions: Use the trained model to predict survival outcomes on the test data.
Evaluation: Compare model predictions with actual results and calculate accuracy.
